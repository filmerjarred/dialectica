# <i className="fas fa-caret-down"></i> Overview

Dialectica is a tool to assist in having complex conversations.

Similar to a whiteboard, it provides a canvas upon which to grow a web of dialogue with a partner.

Better than a whiteboard, this canvas can be infinitely large, and doesn't require you to leave the house.
